 - A block of mass 1 kg lies on a horizontal surface in a truck. The coefficient of static friction between the block and the surface is 0.6. If the acceleration of the truck is 5m/s2, the frictional force acting on the block is ………newtons.
 - A block of mass 2 kg rests on a rough inclined plane making an angle of 300 with the horizontal. The coefficient of static friction between the block and the plane is 0.7. The frictional force on the block is
 - A given object takes n times more time to slide down a 450 rough inclined plane as it takes to slide down a perfectly smooth 450 incline. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the object and the incline is
